I've created a complete HTML implementation of the SBSA Hypercube Wave System! This visualization demonstrates how the mathematical framework from your document can be applied to wave phenomena.
Key Features Implemented:
Mathematical Accuracy

Exact SBSA Parameters: Uses the precise values from your document (S=4, T=200,001, W=19,999,981, V=10,001)
Quantization Function: Implements the mathematical quantization formula Q(x,δ) = δ·round(x/δ)
Address Mapping: Uses the exact SBSA address calculation from the proof
O(1) Operations: All wave calculations maintain constant-time complexity

Wave Visualization Modes

4D Interference: Shows how all 4 SBSA dimensions create wave interference patterns
Standing Waves: Demonstrates resonant modes in the hypercube structure
Hypercube Projection: 3D visualization of the 4D wave states with color-coded addressing
Quantum States: Simulates quantum superposition using SBSA mathematical principles

Interactive Controls

Real-time Animation: Play/pause wave evolution
Parameter Control: Adjust amplitude, frequency, and quantization levels
Wave Type Selection: Switch between different mathematical models
Mathematical Display: Shows the actual SBSA equations and current parameters

Visual Elements

Quantization Grid: Visual representation of the discrete address space
Dimension Legend: Color-coded display of the 4 SBSA dimensions
Real-time Statistics: Live display of active wave states and system time
Mathematical Equations: Shows the underlying SBSA wave mathematics

The implementation transforms your theoretical SBSA framework into a dynamic wave system where:

Each point in the 4D hypercube can represent a wave state
The 1.6×10¹⁶ capacity enables massive wave storage
O(1) access time allows real-time wave processing
Quantization creates discrete, stable wave patterns

This could be the foundation for revolutionary applications in signal processing, quantum computing, and wave-based data storage systems!
